Readline Variables
    Readline  has  variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.  A variable may be
    set in the inputrc file with a statement of the form

           set variable-name value

    Except where noted, readline variables can take the values On or Off (without regard to  case).
    Unrecognized  variable names are ignored.  When a variable value is read, empty or null values,
    "on" (case-insensitive), and "1" are equivalent to On.  All other values are equivalent to Off.
    The variables and their default values are:

    bell-style (audible)
           Controls  what  happens  when readline wants to ring the terminal bell.  If set to none,
           readline never rings the bell.  If set to visible, readline uses a visible bell  if  one
           is available.  If set to audible, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
    bind-tty-special-chars (On)
           If  set to On, readline attempts to bind the control characters treated specially by the
           kernel's terminal driver to their readline equivalents.
    blink-matching-paren (Off)
           If set to On, readline attempts to briefly move the cursor  to  an  opening  parenthesis
           when a closing parenthesis is inserted.
    colored-completion-prefix (Off)
           If  set  to On, when listing completions, readline displays the common prefix of the set
           of possible completions using a different color.  The color definitions are  taken  from
           the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable.
    colored-stats (Off)
           If  set to On, readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate
           their file type.  The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS  envi‐
           ronment variable.
    comment-begin (``#'')
           The  string that is inserted when the readline insert-comment command is executed.  This
           command is bound to M-# in emacs mode and to # in vi command mode.
    completion-display-width (-1)
           The number of screen columns used to display possible matches  when  performing  comple‐
           tion.   The  value  is  ignored if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen
           width.  A value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line.  The default value
           is -1.
    completion-ignore-case (Off)
           If  set  to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive
           fashion.
    completion-map-case (Off)
           If set to On, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, readline  treats  hyphens  (-)  and
           underscores  (_)  as  equivalent  when performing case-insensitive filename matching and
           completion.
    completion-prefix-display-length (0)
           The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that  is
           displayed  without modification.  When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes
           longer than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when  displaying  possible  comple‐
           tions.
    completion-query-items (100)
           This  determines  when  the user is queried about viewing the number of possible comple‐
           tions generated by the possible-completions command.  It may be set to any integer value
           greater than or equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than or
           equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to  view
           them; otherwise they are simply listed on the terminal.
    convert-meta (On)
           If  set  to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key
           sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in effect, using
           escape  as  the meta prefix).  The default is On, but readline will set it to Off if the
           locale contains eight-bit characters.
    disable-completion (Off)
           If set to On, readline will inhibit word  completion.   Completion  characters  will  be
           inserted into the line as if they had been mapped to self-insert.
    echo-control-characters (On)
           When  set  to  On, on operating systems that indicate they support it, readline echoes a
           character corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard.
    editing-mode (emacs)
           Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings  similar  to  Emacs  or  vi.
           editing-mode can be set to either emacs or vi.
    enable-bracketed-paste (Off)
           When  set  to  On,  readline will configure the terminal in a way that will enable it to
           insert each paste into the editing buffer as a single string of characters,  instead  of
           treating  each  character  as  if  it had been read from the keyboard.  This can prevent
           pasted characters from being interpreted as editing commands.
    enable-keypad (Off)
           When set to On, readline will try to enable the application keypad when  it  is  called.
           Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys.
    enable-meta-key (On)
           When set to On, readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to
           support when it is called.  On many terminals, the meta key is used  to  send  eight-bit
           characters.
    expand-tilde (Off)
           If set to On, tilde expansion is performed when readline attempts word completion.
    history-preserve-point (Off)
           If set to On, the history code attempts to place point at the same location on each his‐
           tory line retrieved with previous-history or next-history.
    history-size (unset)
           Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list.  If  set  to  zero,
           any  existing  history  entries  are  deleted and no new entries are saved.  If set to a
           value less than zero, the number of history entries is not  limited.   By  default,  the
           number  of  history  entries  is set to the value of the HISTSIZE shell variable.  If an
           attempt is made to set history-size to a non-numeric value, the maximum number  of  his‐
           tory entries will be set to 500.
    horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)
           When  set to On, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input hori‐
           zontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer than  the  screen  width  rather
           than wrapping to a new line.
    input-meta (Off)
           If  set  to  On,  readline  will  enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not strip the
           eighth bit from the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it  can
           support.   The  name  meta-flag is a synonym for this variable.  The default is Off, but
           readline will set it to On if the locale contains eight-bit characters.
    isearch-terminators (``C-[C-J'')
           The string of characters that should terminate  an  incremental  search  without  subse‐
           quently  executing  the  character  as a command.  If this variable has not been given a
           value, the characters ESC and C-J will terminate an incremental search.
    keymap (emacs)
           Set the current readline keymap.  The set of valid keymap names  is  emacs,  emacs-stan‐
           dard,  emacs-meta,  emacs-ctlx,  vi,  vi-command,  and  vi-insert.   vi is equivalent to
           vi-command; emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.  The  default  value  is  emacs;  the
           value of editing-mode also affects the default keymap.
    emacs-mode-string (@)
           This  string  is  displayed  immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when
           emacs editing mode is active.  The value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard
           set  of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  Use the
           \1 and \2 escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters,  which  can  be
           used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
    keyseq-timeout (500)
           Specifies  the duration readline will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key
           sequence (one that can form a complete key sequence using the input read so far, or  can
           take  additional  input  to  complete  a  longer key sequence).  If no input is received
           within the timeout, readline will use the shorter but complete key sequence.  The  value
           is  specified in milliseconds, so a value of 1000 means that readline will wait one sec‐
           ond for additional input.  If this variable is set to a value  less  than  or  equal  to
           zero,  or  to  a  non-numeric  value, readline will wait until another key is pressed to
           decide which key sequence to complete.
    mark-directories (On)
           If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.
    mark-modified-lines (Off)
           If set to On, history lines that have been  modified  are  displayed  with  a  preceding
           asterisk (*).
    mark-symlinked-directories (Off)
           If  set  to  On,  completed  names  which are symbolic links to directories have a slash
           appended (subject to the value of mark-directories).
    match-hidden-files (On)
           This variable, when set to On, causes readline to match files whose names begin  with  a
           `.'  (hidden files) when performing filename completion.  If set to Off, the leading `.'
           must be supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.
    menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)
           If set to On, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible comple‐
           tions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list.
    output-meta (Off)
           If  set  to On, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather
           than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.  The default is Off, but readline will  set  it
           to On if the locale contains eight-bit characters.
    page-completions (On)
           If set to On, readline uses an internal more-like pager to display a screenful of possi‐
           ble completions at a time.
    print-completions-horizontally (Off)
           If set to On, readline will display completions  with  matches  sorted  horizontally  in
           alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.
    revert-all-at-newline (Off)
           If  set  to  On,  readline  will undo all changes to history lines before returning when
           accept-line is executed.  By default, history lines may be modified and retain  individ‐
           ual undo lists across calls to readline.
    show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)
           This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to On, words which
           have more than one possible completion  cause  the  matches  to  be  listed  immediately
           instead of ringing the bell.
    show-all-if-unmodified (Off)
           This  alters  the  default  behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to
           show-all-if-ambiguous.  If set to On, words which have more than one possible completion
           without  any  possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common
           prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
    show-mode-in-prompt (Off)
           If set to On, add a character to the beginning of  the  prompt  indicating  the  editing
           mode: emacs (@), vi command (:) or vi insertion (+).
    skip-completed-text (Off)
           If  set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match
           into the line.  It's only active when performing completion in the middle of a word.  If
           enabled,  readline  does not insert characters from the completion that match characters
           after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word  following  the  cursor
           are not duplicated.
    vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))
           This  string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi
           editing mode is active and in command mode.  The value is expanded like a  key  binding,
           so  the  standard  set  of  meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is
           available.  Use the \1 and \2 escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing charac‐
           ters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
    vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))
           This  string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi
           editing mode is active and in insertion mode.  The value is expanded like a key binding,
           so  the  standard  set  of  meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is
           available.  Use the \1 and \2 escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing charac‐
           ters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
    visible-stats (Off)
           If  set  to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is appended to
           the filename when listing possible completions.
