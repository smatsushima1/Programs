# DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
#        As  mentioned,  each  screen  command  consists of a "C-a" followed by one other character.  For your conve‐
#        nience, all commands that are bound to lower-case letters are also bound to their control character counter‐
#        parts (with the exception of "C-a a"; see below), thus, "C-a c" as well as "C-a C-c" can be used to create a
#        window. See section "CUSTOMIZATION" for a description of the command.
# 
#        The following table shows the default key bindings:
# 
#        C-a '       (select)      Prompt for a window name or number to switch to.
# 
#        C-a "       (windowlist -b)
#                                  Present a list of all windows for selection.
# 
#        C-a 0       (select 0)
#         ...           ...
#        C-a 9       (select 9)
#        C-a -       (select -)    Switch to window number 0 - 9, or to the blank window.

# 
#        C-a C-a     (other)       Toggle to the window displayed previously.  Note that this binding defaults to the
#                                  command  character  typed  twice, unless overridden.  For instance, if you use the
#                                  option "-e]x", this command becomes "]]".
